### Tasking Manager: Automatized support for Organised Editing Guidelines

**Project Description:** Recently, the OpenStreetMap Foundation, approved the Organised Editing Guidelines. These require reporting back to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, whenever editing efforts are coordinated. 

The Tasking Manager (TM) is OpenStreetMap's favorite tool to managed organised editings, either in place (like mapathons) or virtually (e.g. remote mapping activities for humanitarian cause). A lot of the information required by the Organised Editing Guidelines is already present in the projects' descriptions in the TM. There the idea and feature request arises that the TM could (automatically) report to OpenStreetMap.

The project consists in two main tasks:
  - A preliminary investigation will define contents from TM to be delivered to OSM and eventual changes that need to be done in the TM (e.g. new fields, etc.) and to find out with the OSM system administrators on the best way to make the communication between the applications.
  - Afterwards, the implementation of the previously defined steps and methods in the Tasking Manager.

This project will allow you to code and also be part of the dynamics of an Open Source community. You'll create a very usefull functionality and roll it out to be used by thousands of people.

- **Skills:** Python (Flask), good communication style
- **Difficulty Level:** Medium

### Tasking Manager: Gamification

**Project Description:** The Tasking Manager (TM) is the tool for organized groups to map on OpenStreetMap. HOT itself hosts one, well-used instance for humanitarian mapping.

The Tasking Manager should reward people for doing good mapping and data validation. The project is to develop ideas and solutions around first steps of basic gamification functionality around mapping with the Tasking Manager.
One first example idea: give people points or badges for mapping, validating squares, fixing invalidated squares, and also some for making good quality data.

This project will allow you to code and also be part of the dynamics of an Open Source community. You'll create a very usefull functionality to retain active mappers and roll it out to be used by hundreds of people in an active application.

- **Skills:** Python (Flask), JavaScript (AngularJS)

### Tasking Manager: User experience analysis around mapping projects creation

**Project Description:** The Tasking Manager (TM) is the tool for organized groups to map on OpenStreetMap. HOT itself hosts one, well-used instance for humanitarian mapping.

The wizard to create projects in the TM, is a step-by-step guide to select the region of interest and splits up the area into smaller tasks that mappers can reserve for them, mark them as mapped, when they are done, and then let validators check the data. The project creation wizard shows some inconsistencies and there are good ideas for improvement.

The GSoC project consists in conducting initial interviews with well experienced project managers of the TM, and an analysis on the wizard and potential changes for improvement. After this analysis, the agreed changes and solutions with the HOT team shall be implemented and a new version of the TM will be released.

This project will allow you to code and also be part of the dynamics of an Open Source community. You'll create a very usefull functionality and roll it out to be used by hundreds of people in an active application.
