## A vector tile server infrastructure

**Project Description:**: Across many HOT tools we need to visualize the OpenStreetMap data with updates near real time. Another requirement is being able to generate different visualizations depending on the features that are relevant to specific projects. The vector tiles technology allows us to visualize geospatial data with different styles highlighting the map elements that are more important in each scenario. All commercial OSM vector tiles providers like Mapbox, ESRI and MapTiler updates their data weekly or at larger time intervals. In HOT projects it’s very important to have an update frequency near real time in order to provide more accurate information about the state of the OSM data to users involved in the process of data collection and analysis.

In order to solve that necessity, we need to setup a infrastructure with an updated database, a vector tile server and a set of styles options to suit the main HOT projects. We should document and package it in a Docker setup that could be easily reproduced by other organisations. It could also consider researching cheaper ways of deploying such resources apart from having a database.

### Tasking Manager: Automatized support for Organised Editing Guidelines

**Project Description:** Recently, the OpenStreetMap Foundation, approved the Organised Editing Guidelines. These require reporting back to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, whenever editing efforts are coordinated. 

The Tasking Manager (TM) is OpenStreetMap's favorite tool to managed organised editings, either in place (like mapathons) or virtually (e.g. remote mapping activities for humanitarian cause). A lot of the information required by the Organised Editing Guidelines is already present in the projects' descriptions in the TM. There the idea and feature request arises that the TM could (automatically) report to OpenStreetMap.

The project consists in two main tasks:
  - A preliminary investigation will define contents from TM to be delivered to OSM and eventual changes that need to be done in the TM (e.g. new fields, etc.) and to find out with the OSM system administrators on the best way to make the communication between the applications.
  - Afterwards, the implementation of the previously defined steps and methods in the Tasking Manager.

This project will allow you to code and also be part of the dynamics of an Open Source community. You'll create a very usefull functionality and roll it out to be used by thousands of people.

- **Skills:** Python (Flask), good communication style
- **Difficulty Level:** Medium

### JOSM Plugin for Tasking Manager

**Project Description:** The Tasking Manager is HOT's primary application for coordinating and helping expose volunteers to map areas of the world in OpenStreetMap. This project would focus on building out a plugin for JOSM, the Java-based OpenStreetMap editor. The plugin will interact with the API to checkout tasks to map or validate. 
- **Skills:** Java, Python, API basics
- **Difficulty Level:** Difficult
- **Related readings/links:** 
  - Main repo: https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager
- **Potential Mentors:** 
  - TBD


### Tasking Manager: Gamification

**Project Description:** The Tasking Manager (TM) is the tool for organized groups to map on OpenStreetMap. HOT itself hosts one, well-used instance for humanitarian mapping.

The Tasking Manager should reward people for doing good mapping and data validation. The project is to develop ideas and solutions around first steps of basic gamification functionality around mapping with the Tasking Manager.
One first example idea: give people points or badges for mapping, validating squares, fixing invalidated squares, and also some for making good quality data.

This project will allow you to code and also be part of the dynamics of an Open Source community. You'll create a very usefull functionality to retain active mappers and roll it out to be used by hundreds of people in an active application.
