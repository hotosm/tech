### Tasking Manager: Optimize API Performance

Project Description: Tasking Manager (TM) is a tool for collaborative editing on [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/).
Our current version of the tool - TM V3 is hosted on http://tasks.hotosm.org/. We're currently in the midst of Version 4 release which involves a significant ugrade to the frontend framework - porting from Angular JS to React JS framework.
As a next step our focus is to identify, understand and optimise TM's backend performance.

You will work alongside our tech team and be exposed to:

* Our codebase in Flask microframework
* PostgreSQL Database
* Debugging
* Profiling existing endpoints for CPU performance and memory footprint
* Rest API best practices 
* An active Open Source geospatial community

### Build a Slackbot Router

Project Description: Slack is central to all our communications within and outside our organisation. This project involves creating a simple routing app that will be triggered when someone runs a slack command and return the right results based on the command.

We could have slackbot mapped to slack commands for the following use cases:

* to know if a HOT application is operational
* provide user and project statistics on a specific HOT Project
* provide suspicious changeset summary for HOT Projects on TM

Through this project you will learn about:
* slack APIs and dealing with JSON payloads
* setting up your code on AWS Lambda

**Skills**: Javascript(NodeJS), AWS Lambda

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

### HOT Product Evaluation: Human Centred, User Experience Design

Project Description: HOT has a number of products that have seen multiple successes over the past 10 years. The products have evolved from humble beginnings into some of the most used tools in the OSM community. We would like to get a sense of how our products are used, and by whom by conducting an evaluation driven by user experience and human centred design philosophies. We want to understand where the value in each of our products lies and how we can enhance their accessibility and useability for a variety of users.

Some key skills/aspects of the project include:
* Undertaking user and community based research to understand end user needs
* Using UX research to identify pain points for current users
* Identify key value propositions within the current product suite
* Complete Persona Mapping to identify key user groups for the current product suite. 

**Skills**: Human Centred Design, User Experience Design

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

## HOT Tech: Feedback and Technical Support

Project Description: As HOT’s products strengthen and users increase on a daily basis, HOT needs to ensure that technical support requests and feedback are gathered from all users within the HOT community in a way that is standardized across all it’s products. Building upon current practices, HOT is looking for an individual that can strengthen current Technical Support and Feedback systems and integrate open source standard practices to reduce workload and capacity of the HOT tech development team. The outcome should be conducive to supporting both the HOT community and the HOT tech team. 

Some key skills/aspects of the project include:
* Understanding business needs for HOT Technology users and HOT tech team
* Understand workflows for HOT Tech team and ensure feedback is inline with team requests. 
* Understand community needs
* Propose/Develop a system that integrates business requirements and the needs of the HOT tech team, HOT internal and HOT community.
