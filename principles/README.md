# Ethics and Principles

**Ethics:**

***Human[itarian]*** | Our Human[itarian] ethic is our commitment to people as our priority. At the centre of all our technology sits a human. The ultimate purpose of our technology is to improve human conditions. We use technology to enable and amplify real human efforts. Human first, [itarians] next.

***Open*** | Our Open ethic permeates all we do. Our actions  reflect radical openness and transparency. We encourage open inputs and outputs. Our team and technology openly welcomes and engages cooperation, collaboration and contributions.

***Truth*** | Our Truth ethic speaks to our belief that the truth on the ground guides us. We believe that the lived experience of those we work with and for is the ultimate authority for what is most needed and most meaningful. When decisions are not clear, we use to truth on the ground to guide our next step. 

 

**Principles:**

*When we know our principles, our decisions are easy. Our actions are motivated by the principles that unite and guide us. This is what hot_tech is built on.*

1. Collective Centric // _To go fast go alone, to go far, go together._  
Our first principle is our first priority.  We are collaborative at our core. We apply self-regulation and welcome open contribution, review and feedback. We support our collectives professionally and personally. We invest in their well-being and their growth. We provide security and stability. We empower the lowest user in the stack. When our collective thrives, so do we.

2. Include with intention // _If we don’t intentionally include, we will unintentionally exclude._ 
Inclusion begins with intention. We acknowledge that things can be normal, without being average. We use and value the edges and the margins, because we believe the edge is too far from the center. Diverse voices create deeper harmonies. Through equity comes resilience. 

3. Human centred design // _An instrument is only musical to someone who can play it_  
We design to solve human problems. We design from patterns to details. We design experiences that foster the well-being of our collectives.  We design digital spaces where humans belong.

4. agile to amplify // _Respond to things as they are, not as they might be._  
We can’t predict the future, but we can contribute to it, together. We observe and interact. We embrace change. We are not afraid to fail, learn and adjust in order to adapt. We conscientiously and continuously evolve our products and our people. 

5. Interoperable Autonomy //_The art of working independently, together_  
We value independence, initiative and ingenuity. We celebrate creators, makers, tinkerers and hacktivists. We integrate rather than separate. We want our ecosystem to embrace and incubate ideas and share success and learning of the few to the many. 

6. Solve small and simple // _A journey of a thousand miles, begins with a single step_  
We seek sophistication in simplicity. We want to try and know, before we grow. We believe we should start where we are, do what we can, with what we have. We believe only simple and sustainable solutions are scalable.

7. Resource Respect // _Society grows when we plant trees under whose shade we will never sit._  
We never take what we have for granted. We are lean in principle and practice. We work to collect resources when they are available and use them in times of need. We value and use resources and services that can be renewed and reused. We aim to obtain a yield that can be reinvested in our future. We ensure energy invested is energy returned. Think tomorrow, act today - sustainability for seven generations.

8. Examined evolution // _Follow the evidence wherever it leads_  
We evolve through experimentation, empiricism and evidence. We build, measure, learn and grow. Our decision making is driven by data. We value reason, logic and rationale, particularly when practiced in discussion and debate. With inclusive and representative data we move forward together.

9. Data depth // _Behind every piece of data is a story_  
We want to use our data to share untold stories. We make the vulnerable visible and amplify their voice. We want our data to be as deep as it is broad. We want our data to be open, accessible and engaging. We want our data to inspire and support action.
